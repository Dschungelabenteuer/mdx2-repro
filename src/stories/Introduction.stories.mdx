Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `stories` directory to learn how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

## Broken code block (this is related to @mdx-js/react version)

```ts
import styleImport from '@bkg/style-import'
// ...
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    styleImport('@bkg/design', 'style'),
  ]
})
```

Also, docs elements are not prefixed with the ".sbdocs.sbdocs-el" escape hatch
